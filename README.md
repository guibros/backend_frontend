# Backend Server with a Frontend WebSite


A frontend web site with a Node.js backend.  Users can log in on their profile. Any users can post products (description, price tag, etc.). One user can add, remove or update each post on its web page. Each post is saved into MongoDB Atlas using a predetermined schema. The backend server manages the routes (fetch, post, update, delete).
